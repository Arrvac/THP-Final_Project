<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Harry cover][product-screenshot]](https://the-final-project-production.herokuapp.com/)

Covid 19 had a devastating effect not only on the healthcare sector but the economy as well. Small businesses were the ones who suffered the most. Monthlee provides a way for small businesses to expand their sales channels and maintain a revenue stream even when they cannot open their shops to customers.

Monthlee provides an online subscription platform which allows the small business to sell monthly and weekly subscriptions to their clients. We take care of everything from creating the website, handling the subscriptions, SEO optimization of the website, and reaching a large ex-pat community in France. 

We will give a list with the client information to the small business and they fulfill the order and handle the shipping.

### Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Ruby on rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

A person visits the personal website Monthlee has created for the small business. When the visitor finds a subscription they would like to purchase, they signup (or log in if they have already done so) to add the desired subscription to their cart, add their payment details, and voila! They eagerly wait for their weekly or monthly subscription.
